## PTSourceDraw3D Basics

### Selections

In PTSourceDraw3D, most actions work on the current selection (all the vertices & triangles selected), or on everything if nothing is selected.
To select items, either click on an object in the "Objects List", or select the vertices & triangles individually by hitting "S" on your keyboard to change to selection mode, and drag a rectangle around the vertices & triangles you want.

You can also hold the "Control" key (or "Ctrl" key) as you click on individual vertices in the "Vertices List" & "Triangles List", or holding the "Control" key as you right-click near vertices in any of the views.

### Edit Modes

There are 5 different editing modes, as shown in the "Edit Mode" menu. The helpbar on the bottom shows the different operations you can do in each mode. For example, in "Move" mode, dragging the left mouse button around will move the view.
However, if you hold down the "Control" key on your keyboard, dragging the left mouse button around will move the currently selected vertices (or all vertices if nothing is selected).

The basic functions of each mode are:
* Edit mode (hit 'E'):	Move individual vertices.
* Select mode (hit 'S'):	Make a selection of vertices & triangles by dragging left mouse button.
* Zoom mode (hit 'Z'):	Change an object's size, or zoom a view in & out.
* Move mode (hit 'M'):	Move an object, or a view.
* Rotate mode (hit 'R'):	Rotate an object.
